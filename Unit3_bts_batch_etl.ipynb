        "Throughout this workflow, we designed a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline using BigQuery ML to analyze and predict flight patterns. We began by cleaning and preparing the flights dataset, then trained a linear regression model to predict arrival delays. The results showed a moderate fit (R² ≈ 0.49) and reasonable error metrics, with predicted delays tracking the general scale of actual delays. Next, we built a logistic regression classifier to predict whether a flight would arrive significantly late. This model performed extremely well — achieving near-perfect accuracy, precision, and recall — indicating that the delay threshold we modeled was highly learnable from the available features.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we applied K-Means clustering to segment flights into groups based on delay characteristics and distance. The clustering results revealed clear separations between short-haul, medium-haul, and long-haul flights as well as differences in typical delay behavior. Each cluster centroid reflected meaningful patterns — for example, certain clusters corresponded to flights with consistently lower delays, while others captured long-distance routes with higher variability. Together, these models demonstrate a powerful analytical pipeline capable of predicting delays, classifying risky flights, and uncovering structural patterns across an entire flight dataset."
